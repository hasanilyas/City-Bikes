# City-Bikes
Tasks given are not complete as i was not able to figure out a right way to transfer data between angular.js and Node.js. I was not able to correctly use the http get and post (URL In parameters)  method to communicate between front end and back-end.

Application is getting JSON data from CityBikes Api and results of both tasks can be seen in console when you run application on server. 
City (Melbourne) is hard coded in server.js file to get stations and Empty Slots. 

station.html and emptyslots.html, both pages have forms which ask users for the City.
